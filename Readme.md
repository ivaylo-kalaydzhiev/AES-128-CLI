<h1>Overview</h1>
This repository contains two projects, that each implement AES-128 encryption and decryption.
<h2>SimplyAES</h2>
This project contains just one C++ file, that has a hardcoded message, which it than encrypts and decrypts. You can use it to try out and understand the AES encryption flow.
<h2>AES-128-CLI</h2>
This is a more complete CLI, that allows users to encrypt/ decrypt whole files, using custom password.
<h2>WARNING</h2>
Don't actually use this project to encrypt sensitive data. It is utterly unsafe. It is only made for educational purposes in trying to understand the AES encryption flow.
<h2>Runing the projects</h2>
The projects were developed on an Intel Mac with CLion, therefore you could easiliy run any of them with the CLion IDE.

Alternatively:
- Clone the project
- Exract the .cpp files
- Run GCC to compile an exexutable
- Run the executable
